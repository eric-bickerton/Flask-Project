# Flask-Project
Personal website built from TechWithTim Flask Tutorial

I guess the idea is to have a blog-style website with navigation links to sections like the ones below:

About - about the website
Bio - about me
Music - mp3s of music recordings or from Ableton
Math - topics related to math I'm interested in...I don't really do a lot of math anymore
Puzzles - maybe I'll make some puzzles
    Sudoku - I am not fast at sudoku. It takes me a long time to solve even easy ones.
    Crossword puzzles - I think I am better at crosswords than sudoku but I am stumped sometimes
